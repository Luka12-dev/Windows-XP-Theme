WINDOWS XP BOOT SCREEN GUIDE
========================================

The Windows XP boot screen image is included in:
Boot/WindowsXP_Boot.gif

However, changing the Windows 11 boot screen requires additional tools
due to security restrictions.

========================================
WHY CAN'T WE CHANGE IT AUTOMATICALLY?
========================================

Windows Security:
-----------------
- Boot screen is protected by Secure Boot
- Requires UEFI firmware modification
- Cannot be changed via registry alone
- Windows defends boot process integrity

Safety First:
-------------
- Modifying boot files incorrectly can prevent Windows from starting
- We don't include automatic boot modification for safety
- Manual process ensures you understand the risks

========================================
METHOD 1: HackBGRT (RECOMMENDED)
========================================

HackBGRT is a safe, open-source tool for changing boot screen.

STEP 1: Download HackBGRT
--------------------------
Official: https://github.com/Metabolix/HackBGRT/releases
Download: HackBGRT-X.X.zip

STEP 2: Prepare XP Boot Image
------------------------------
1. Open Boot/WindowsXP_Boot.gif in image editor
2. Convert to PNG or BMP format
3. Resize to your screen resolution (1920x1080, etc.)
4. Save as: splash.bmp

STEP 3: Install HackBGRT
-------------------------
1. Disable Secure Boot in BIOS/UEFI (required)
2. Extract HackBGRT
3. Run setup.exe as Administrator
4. Follow installation wizard
5. Place splash.bmp in HackBGRT config folder

METHOD 2: WINDOWS BOOT LOGO CHANGER
========================================

Another tool option (use with caution).

Requirements:
-------------

========================================
METHOD 3: MANUAL UEFI MODIFICATION (ADVANCED)
========================================

FOR EXPERTS ONLY - Can break your system!

This involves:
- Accessing UEFI firmware
- Modifying boot graphics
- Risk of bricking system

NOT RECOMMENDED unless you're experienced with UEFI.

========================================
LOGON SCREEN (EASIER ALTERNATIVE)
========================================

While boot screen is difficult, you CAN change the logon screen!

STEP 1: Convert Boot Image
---------------------------
1. Open Boot/WindowsXP_Boot.gif
2. Export first frame as JPG
3. Resize to screen resolution
4. Save as: xp_logon.jpg

STEP 2: Apply as Logon Background
----------------------------------

2. Personalization > Lock screen
3. Background > Picture
4. Browse to xp_logon.jpg
5. Apply

Result: You'll see XP boot image on login screen!
